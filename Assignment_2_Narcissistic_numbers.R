# Assignment 2 - Narcissistic Numbers
# BTC1855
# By Trinley Palmo

# R version 4.4.0

#' Plan
#' Step 1: Read user input
#' Step 2: Check user input to see if it is numeric and a three digit positive 
#'         number
#' if it is not numeric
#'   Print an error message prompting user to re-run code and try again
#' Step 3: Check if it is an integer. (Added as bug fix)
#' if it is not an integer
#'   Print an error message prompting user to try again.
#' Step 4: Check if it is less than or equal to 99
#' if it is
#'   Print an error message saying it is too small and to try again
#' Step 5: Check if it is greater than or equal to 1000
#' if it is
#'   Print an error message saying it is too big and to try again.
#' Step 6: If everything is good, print a message saying thank you.
#' Step 7: Break down user input into a vector of digits
#' Step 8: Sum the cubes of each of the digits.
#' Step 9: Check if the sum is equal to the original user input
#'  if F:
#'    Print a message saying "(original user input) is not a narcissitic number."
#'  if T:
#'    Print a message saying "(original user input) is a narcissistic number."


#Code review (H.A.): Great idea adding a plan, there's a logical flow of ideas, and I can see how your code will pan out from the very start. 


# Prompt the user to enter a three digit positive number
three_dig <- readline(prompt = "Please enter a three digit positive number: ")

# Convert user input into an object of type "numeric" to use in conditions below.
three_dig_num <- as.numeric(three_dig)

# If it returns TRUE for the object (as in it is NA), that means the user input 
# was not a number.
if (is.na(three_dig_num)) {
  print("Your entry is not a number. Please try again.")
  
# We need a three digit positive number, which it means it has to be an integer.
# It also cannot be less than or equal to 99 OR greater than or equal to 1000. 
# If it is, a new input must be entered.
} else if (grepl("\\.", three_dig)) {
  print("Your entry is not an integer. Please try again.")
} else if (99 >= three_dig_num) {
  print("Your number is too small! Please try again.")
} else if (three_dig_num >= 1000) {
  print("Your number is too big! Please try again.")

#Code review (H.A.): Great use of else if statements here. I also like the logic used, how you satisfy the false conditions before the true. 

# If the user input passed all of the above conditions, we can then check if it 
# is an Armstrong number.
} else {
  print("Thank you! Let's see if it is narcissistic.")
  
  # Using the original user input, which was of type "string", split the numbers 
  # into digits. By using double square brackets, I am extracting the elements of
  # the output, rather than the list itself that contains the digit characters.

#Code review (H.A.): Great use of the strsplit function, logic checks out here. 

  digs <- strsplit(three_dig, "")[[1]]
  
  # The individual digits are converted back into type "numeric", so that each of 
  # the numbers can be cubed.
  digs_cube <- as.numeric(digs) ^ 3
  
  # Each of the digits are summed and saved to be compared to the original user 
  # input.
  digs_cube_sum <- sum(digs_cube)

  #Code review (H.A.): Logic checks out here, comments added are really helpful to tag along. 


  # Check if the number is narcissistic. A narcissistic number, or an Armstrong 
  # number, is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its own digits. 
  # 153, 370, 371, 407 are three digit Armstrong numbers.
  
  # If the sum of the cubes does not equal to the original user input, it will
  # return a statement stating that it was not an Armstrong number. Otherwise, if
  # they do equal to each other, it will return a statement stating that it is
  # a narcissistic number.
  if (three_dig_num != digs_cube_sum) {
    print(paste(three_dig, "is not a narcissistic number."))
  } else {
    print(paste(three_dig, "is a  narcissistic number. YAY!!"))
  }
}

#Code review (H.A.): Great job ! I ran the code and it works as intended. Tried different values and the code works as expected. I liked the plan outline and the detailed comments that allowed me to tag along and understand logic.
